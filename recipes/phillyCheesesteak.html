    <h1>Philly Cheesesteak</h1>
    <img src="../images/Philly-CheeseSteak.jpeg" alt="" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Philly Cheesesteak is a sandwich made with super thinly sliced ribeye
      steak, caramelized onion, and provolone cheese. That simple combination is
      the original classic as made popular on the East Coast. The Philly
      Cheesesteak has been modified on the West Coast to include bell peppers
      and mushrooms but a true “Philly” only has steak, onion and cheese served
      over a roll.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ribeye is the steak of choice for Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches. It is
      well-marbled and tender when cooked. Another cut that we have used with
      great results is flank steak which is lean but very tender when cut
      against the grain. You will need a little extra oil on your cooking
      surface if using flank steak.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb Ribeye steak, trimmed and thinly sliced*</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp Sea salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp Black pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 sweet onion, (large), diced</li>
      <li>8 slices provolone cheese, mild (not aged provolone)</li>
      <li>4 Hoagie Rolls, sliced 3/4 through</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove, pressed</li>
      <li>2-4 Tbsp mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Slice hoagie rolls 3/4 of the way through with a serrated knife. Dice
          onions and thinly slice beef.*
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In a small bowl, stir together 2 Tbsp softened butter with 1 pressed
          garlic clove. Spread garlic butter onto the cut sides of 4 hoagie
          roll. Toast the buns on a large skillet, flat cooktop or griddle on
          medium heat until golden brown then set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add 1 Tbsp oil to your pan/cooktop and sautee diced onions until
          caramelized then transfer to a bowl.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Increase to high heat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Spread the super thinly
          sliced steak in an even layer. Let brown for a couple of minutes
          undisturbed then flip and season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black
          pepper. Sautee until steak is fully cooked through then stir in the
          caramelized onions.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Divide into 4 even portions and top each with 2 slices of cheese and
          turn off the heat so the cheese will melt without overcooking the
          meat.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Spread a thin layer of mayo on the toasted side of each roll. Working
          with one portion at a time, place a toasted bun over each portion and
          use a spatula to scrape the cheesy beef into your bun as you flip it
          over. Serve warm.
        </p>
