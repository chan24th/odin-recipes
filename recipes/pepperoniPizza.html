    <h1>Pepperoni Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../images/Pepperoni-Pizza.jpeg" alt="" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Use a pizza stone:</strong> This is my favorite way to get a great
      crust, but it does require some equipment. You need a pizza stone and a
      pizza peel (the thing you use to slide the pizza onto the stone). If you
      have those two things, though, you can open up a pizza joint in your
      kitchen! This is a reliable, low-stress method once you get the hang of
      it. The pizza ends up being a bit more freeform, and you can make the
      crust nice and thin, which I like. A large pizza cooks in 12-14 minutes on
      a hot stone.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Use a cast iron skillet:</strong> If you don't have a pizza stone,
      put your dough into a large cast iron skillet, and press it out and up the
      sides a bit. You'll get a slightly thicker crust than you would with the
      pizza stone, but not deep-dish thickness. Set the skillet on your stovetop
      for two minutes over high heat (this helps form a crispy crust), then
      transfer it to your oven to finish baking.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade (I like this no-knead
        version, though note that this recipe makes enough dough for 2 pizzas)
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (see below)</li>
      <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
      <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
      <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
      <h3>Pizza Sauce</h3>
      <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated onion</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Preheat the oven:</strong>
          Preheat oven to 500°F. If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it in
          the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as well.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong> Make the sauce:</strong>
          If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the ingredients. The
          sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza. You can easily
          double it if you are making more than one pizza.
        </p>
      </li>

          <strong>Roll out the dough:</strong>
          Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, let
          it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. For a large
          pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Add the toppings:</strong>
          Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively, fit
          it into a large cast-iron. Add sauce in a light layer all over the
          pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. Chop half of the
          pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the pizza with grated
          cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. Season with black pepper.
        </p>
      </li>

        <p>
          <strong>Cook the Pizza:</strong>
          If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into the center
          of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the
          pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6-8 minutes, or
          until the crust is golden brown and charred in spots. If you're using
          a skillet, press the dough into a cast iron skillet and add toppings.
          Place the skillet over a high heat burner for 2 minutes to get it
          preheated and get the crust cooking right away. Then transfer to a 500
          ̊F oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden
          brown.
        </p>
      </li>

        <p>
          <strong>Slice and serve:</strong>
          Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the pizza
          rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh oregano
          (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad.
